# drvmap_secure drvmap with a safer capcom wrapper

This project uses the awesome drvmap project of wlan (https://github.com/not-wlan/drvmap) but uses a safer capcom wrapper, inspired by can1357 (https://github.com/can1357/safe_capcom).
I did this because drvmap kept crashing when loading the capcom driver. This version should be safer.
